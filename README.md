# hello-world-
New b here at GitHub and having heard so many good things and positive results in my research, I am super excited to learn with this open source platform!!! I am BRAND new, but am open and willing to learn.. No doubt I am in the right place after reviewing some of the material... I take comfort in knowing that I am a part of this amazing community which is the literal forefront of its kind... REVOLUTION 
I am one of the most ambitious, yet reckless people I know, which is a cause of me having to learn such resiliency.. When I commit to something or someone I am all in, head first!. I feel good about GitHub and can see this being my new passion.. I read energy well and this community is intriguing and inviting at the same time, and the vibe is as if it is alive... I would just like to say, for anyone who may be reading this, even the ones who aren't, that I am like a sponge; any and all information/time that is shared with me will blossom and do backflips. I have a purpose here and it I am quite obsessive, a little neurotic, and out of my mind... I have personality for days, as well as ignorance... If you are reading this much then it is no accident you are here.. Hit me up so I know who you are, together we will all prosper***
